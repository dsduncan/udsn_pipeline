# Udacity data science nano degree pipeline project

I'm building a pipeline for predicting the topic of messages sent during a
disaster. There are a few steps here:
1. Process and clean up the training data
2. Train an NLP model to predict categories for the messages
3. Set up the model to score text
4. Park tha process behind a web front end
